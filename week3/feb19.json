    "note": "Malaysia remains committed to repatriating around 1,200 Myanmar nationals held in the country's immigration detention centers next Tuesday, despite strong protests from civil rights groups and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. While Myanmar is in turmoil over the recent military coup, a source in Malaysia's Immigration Department tells Nikkei Asia the detainees will be sent back as scheduled, requesting anonymity because he was not authorized to speak. An analyst, meanwhile, acknowledges Malaysia's concerns about illegal immigration but argues the controversy shows the need for better coordination with the U.N."
