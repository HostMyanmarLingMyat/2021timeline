    "note": "According to Reuters, tens of thousands of protesters take to the streets in major cities. It is the ninth straight day of anti-coup demonstrations, after a fearful night as residents formed patrols and the army rolled back laws protecting freedoms. 'We created two teams with our neighbors, each team with three to four people, to secure the streets in the neighborhood,' said a seafood seller in Yangon. The team formed a makeshift checkpoint from 8:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. armed with sticks. He said it was to 'protect ourselves because we don't know what kind of weapons the suspicious person might bring. But we are trying not to be violent.'"
